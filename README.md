# The Great Gatsby

### jsZgb#39 meetup talk

On my quest to find the best static site generator I have finally found a contender that can take the crown. Why? It combines all the cool features from modern JavaScript development into a usable and developer friendly environment. Oh yea.. and it's "serverless".


```
    yarn // to install all packages
    gatsby develop // to run dev server
    gatsby build // to build static sites
```
